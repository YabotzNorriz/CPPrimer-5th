## Overview

Comments are a thing that the compiler will simple ignore when compiling the program. Generally they are used to guide the programmer(s) to know what's happening and guide them trough the code.

## Simple comment

Represented by a double slash `//`, a simple comment or a single line comment is a comment only in one line, if you need to go to the following line, it's necessary to put another double slash:

```c++
// This is a single line comment
// I canÂ´t write more than one line after time
```

## Multiple line comment

Represented by a double slash and between then two asterisks `/* */`, a multiple line comment or a *docstring* is a comment that spams multiple line, everything that is between this two symbols will be considered an comment.

```c++
/*
This
is
a
multiple
line
comment
*/
```
